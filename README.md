# Dysarthria-Detection
We built a system to automatically classify the severity of Dysarthria, a speech disorder, into four levels using audio recordings. MFCCs were used with SVM and DNN models, while Mel-spectrograms were used with a CNN. We applied pitch, speed, and noise augmentation to improve robustness. The CNN gave the best results on the UA-Speech dataset.
